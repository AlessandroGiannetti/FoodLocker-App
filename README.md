This repository is for the final project of the Mobile Application And Cloud Computing course (Master of Science Engineering in Computer Science - Sapienza University of Rome).

This project has been developed by Alessandro Giannetti. 
I'am a student of the Master in Engineering of Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome.

I developed an android application that integrates the services of firebase and rails API on heroku, to create a fitness social with which you can post your goals and have a diary with food and macro nutrients taken.
